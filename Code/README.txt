######### PULMONARY AILMENT CLASSIFICATION USING PHONOPNEUMOGRAPHY#######

Lung auscultation is one of the most popular diagnostic modalities used 
by the pulmonary experts to analyze the condition of the respiratory system. 
When auscultating various areas on the anterior and posterior sides of the 
chest, lung sounds can be detected. Lung sounds are indicative of different 
anatomical flaws in the lungs and provide accurate prognoses regarding 
respiratory health, resulting in more trustworthy medical tool for identifying 
respiratory disorders.
According to a recent study conducted by the world health organization 
(WHO), approximately ten million (M) people die each year as a result of 
respiratory diseases. In order to analyze respiratory sounds on a computer,
we developed a cost-effective and easy-to-use Algorithm that can be used 
with any device. Employed two types of machine learning algorithms; 
Gamma tone Cestrum Coefficients Features in a Convolutional Neural 
Network and since using GTCC and STFC features with a CNN-LSTM 
algorithm using four data sets for CNN-LSTM algorithm to classify 
respiratory audio: (1) healthy versus pathological classification; (2) rale, 
rhonchus, and normal sound classification; (3) singular respiratory sound 
type classification; and (4) audio type classification with all sound types.
